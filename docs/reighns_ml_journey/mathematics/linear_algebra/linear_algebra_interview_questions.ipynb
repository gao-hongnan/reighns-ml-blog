However, we know from my previous chapter on **Basis and Dimension**'s **Theorem (Equivalent Basis Definition)** that we necessarily need $4$ vectors in $\\R^{4}$ to span this subspace. Consequently, $3$ vectors (columns of $\\A$) cannot possibly **span** the entire $\\R^4$ (**column space of $\\A$ here**) and hence there are vectors $\\b$ that are not **linear combinations of columns of $\\A$**.\n",

One would've thought that **all** kinds of $\\b$ will have a solution $\\x$, as opposed to the **overdetermined system**, but this is not true! Why? - - We can illustrate with an easy example, if $m = 3, n = 4$, then $\\b$ is made up of linear combination of columns of $\\A$, although we have $4$ columns, that does not mean all columns span the entire $\\R^4$ space.
