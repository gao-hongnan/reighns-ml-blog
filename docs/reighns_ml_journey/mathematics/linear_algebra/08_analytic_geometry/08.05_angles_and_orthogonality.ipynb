    "\n",
    "Before the concept of orthogonality, one may take a while to realize that R(A) UNION N(A) = R^n. Even though the rank-nullity theorem tells us that their dimension of the nullspace and row space is n, it did not specifically say that the union of them is the whole Rn space (though intuitively they are if you stare at it long enough). But the main point is, with the orthogonal concept introduced, every vector in the nullspace is \"perpendicular\" to those in the row space, and that means that any vector n in N(A) is of a \"different axis/dimension\" as those in R(A), and this indicates linear independence of them. Now this means the basis vectors of N(A) and R(A) are linearly independent, and hence when unioned, they make up the whole R^n space."
