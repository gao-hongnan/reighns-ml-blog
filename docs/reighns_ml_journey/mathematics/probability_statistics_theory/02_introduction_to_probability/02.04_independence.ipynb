    "The formula above is not at all intuitive.\n",

    "A more intuitive way to think about it is to think that two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if the occurrence of $B$ does not affect the probability of the occurrence of $A$. This can be illustrated further with the following narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume the scenario: given that $B$ occurred (with or without event $A$ occurring), what is the probability of event $A$ occurring? In other words, we are now in the universe in which $B$ occurred - which is the full right circle. In that right hand side circle ($B$), the probability of $A$ is the area of $A$ intersect $B$ divided by the area of the circle - or in other words, the probability of $A$ is the number of outcomes of $A$ in the right circle (which is $n(A \\cap B)$, over the number of outcomes of the reduced sample space $B$. Therefore, if we think of independence as event $B$ occuring not affecting event $A$ occurring, then it means that the probability of $A$ occurring is still the probability of $A$ occurring. i.e $\\P(A|B) = \\P(A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows immediately that $$P(A) = P(A|B) = \\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\Longrightarrow P(A) P(B) = P(A \\cap B)$$\n",
